# Trapbot-Extended
A discord bot I created for fun in 10th grade for use with my friends.

Features include:
- Generate random quotes, jokes, facts, insults, and activities
- Stores a "pool" of messages for each server to which members can add/remove messages to, then say a random message from the pool
- Play music in voice channels
- Speed game: a game where users must send a message every second for as long as possible
